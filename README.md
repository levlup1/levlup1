## Hi there my name is levlup1 I went through my whole life kidding myself that I was proficient and knowledgeable about technology and computers but boy/they/them was I wrong. I faked it so long and miserably enrolling in college computer science courses and I don't know who I got that trait from because I thought the basic classes were a waste of time and you can learn them online. I finally took an intro to Networking and it finally gave me the process of how actually to work with a computer. The biggest productivity boosts I get are because of my ADHD the biggest antagonist to my productivity is month subscription software. I have been very fortunate to make the acquaintance of an IT professional and we trade photo gear rentals in turn, I get to ask him how to get through the rough patches of a normal Personal/Business desktop. I'm very proud to be labeled as a Jack of Trades. I believe having a healthy set of options is my favorite weapon. As far as hobbies I love decorating, Adventures from rollerblading on the beach or going camping in the wild. I'm a huge snowboard and skateboard enthusiast. My near-term goal is to go join a pickup game of Volleyball and start paddle boarding, I even already have the paddle. The skill I'm pushing at the moment is 3d modeling for video games or feature films using UAV automation to make 3d renders. i enjoy web design and the reason why I'm taking the time to learn GitHub is I dream of b being efficient.ðŸ‘‹My current project is building a personal business website using Bootstrap and Netlify, editing a music video I shot and produced with me as the crew and one almost musician. My business will be incorporation ideally preplanned drone photogrammetry shoots. I'm interested in making a simple GUI for a bot or web scrapper because that sounds fun.  My favorite package manager is Chocolatey and I recently restored an old Desktop PC on which I installed a variety of popOS via a bootable drive. I felt fancy nerdy. I'm also in the middle of building my first desktop with supervision and I'm looking forward to learning Blender. I'm not involved in any community at the moment but I think discord changed my life for the better. it took a lot of channels until I found one where I was even lucky enough to make friends.
